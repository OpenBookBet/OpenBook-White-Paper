# Advantages for LPs

* A Web3 native way to engage in the sports betting community without shouldering the specific adrenaline filled risks involved in wagers.
* Anonymity. OpenBook only needs a Bookie’s public wallet address to service them. We don’t need or want any user’s personal information.
* Intuitive and informative interface produced to be as to-the-point as possible. No clutter, just ease of navigation to the things Bookies want to see and do.
* High yield uncorrelated with the Market
