# Market Participants

When looking at the landscape of gambling and sports betting in general, we see a steadily growing industry full of an increasingly diverse range of market participants. This is great news for the future of sports betting, and something we took into consideration when designing our project.

Too often sportsbooks cater only to their dedicated and die hard users, making them inaccessible to the regular person. On the other hand, many upcoming Web3 pages are also too focused on designing for their particular audience. OpenBook is designed to be accessible and familiar to both of these audiences, as well as providing a usable and easily navigated experience for betting and liquidity provision alike.

Based on our unique model, participants in the OpenBook sportsbook protocol come from two primary branches: the gamblers that will be making bets on the site, and the liquidity providers that fill the pool the gamblers bet from.

## Liquidity Providers (Bookies)

The second primary user base for OpenBook is the liquidity providers, who from now on will be referred to as Bookies. The OpenBook Bookies act as a replacement to the traditional “house” or casino; Bettors bet against a single liquidity pool filled by individual Bookies.
