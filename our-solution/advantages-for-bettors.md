# Advantages for Bettors

The OpenBook sportsbook protocol’s composite model is intended to bring as many benefits to its users as possible. We’ve already discussed how the features of the protocol are designed to solve issues prevalent in our precursor’s models. With the OpenBook DAO on the horizon (see section 11), we feel that it’s important to delineate the advantages originally intended for Bettors:

* Lower unnecessary charges to the Bettor cutting into their profit margins - lower vig and no taxes.
* High bet limits that Bettors are used to enjoying at other centralized sports books.
* Anonymity. No worries of KYC or being banned for using the OpenBook services as intended. We don’t need or want any user’s personal information.
* Simple and familiar betting interface through and through. It’s in the Bettor’s best interest for the interface to be understandable and easy to navigate.
