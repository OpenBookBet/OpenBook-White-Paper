# Advantages for Bookies

As users of the OpenBook protocol, we want Bookies to feel as at home as the Bettors. The desires and motivations for Bookies are different than that of the Bettors, so it’s not a straighforward correspondence of benefits between the two user types. With these notes in mind, here is a small list of the benefits OpenBook intends to confer upon its Bookies:

* A Web3 native way to engage in the sports betting community without shouldering the specific adrenaline filled risks involved in wagers.
* Anonymity. OpenBook only needs a Bookie’s public wallet address to service them. We don’t need or want any user’s personal information.
* Intuitive and informative interface produced to be as to-the-point as possible. No clutter, just ease of navigation to the things Bookies want to see and do.
