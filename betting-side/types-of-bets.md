# Types of Bets

The sports betting landscape is riddled with a huge variety of betting types for gamblers to enjoy and participate in. For the Alpha prototype, OpenBook will only serve money line type wagers. This is due to time constraints and for the sake of prototyping. Following some successful growth, OpenBook hopes to host many of the following bet types on the platform:

### Money line

A basic wager where players bet on one side or the other to win. The favorite gets a minus (-) on their odds, while the underdog gets a plus (+), which correspond to the payout amounts should the wager win.

**The only betting type supported by OpenBook Alpha**

### Point spread

Similar to money line, but using a specified point value that either favorite or underdog should win or lose by.

### Totals

Bet on the over or the under of the proposed combined score of the match.

### Parlays

A combination of two or more bets (sometimes up to fifteen) into a single wager, all of which have to win for the parlay to win with the payout increasing proportional to the number of bets included on the ticket.

### Teasers

Parlays with better player odds but lower payouts.

### Props&#x20;

A fan favorite bet type that allows players to bet on a chaotic array of topics ranging anywhere from the outcome of the coin toss to individual player performance.

### Futures

Wagers on long term outcomes, like who will win the Super Bowl or which player will win a league’s MVP award.



Many of these betting types are what keep sports betting interesting for long time players, so we want to make sure that we don’t forget about these additional bet formats. These will be developed in the future, potentially for the OpenBook v1 release (more details of which are available in section 11).
