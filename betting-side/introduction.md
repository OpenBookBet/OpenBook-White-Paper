# Introduction

Both sides of the OpenBook sportsbook protocol could not operate without one another, much like yin and yang. Without the Bettors, there would be no need for the Bookies, and without the Bookies there would be nothing for the Bettors to place bets against. We will first tackle the betting side.

Bettors are the agents of this side of OpenBook. They place bets using our web interface which are executed on the Polygon blockchain, the details of which from both the Bettor and blockchain perspectives are the topic of the next section.
