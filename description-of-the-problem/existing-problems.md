# Existing Problems

All of this leads us to the discussion of the major issues with sports betting right now. To be clear, let’s delineate four of the most glaring issues for gamblers and those behind the books alike:

1. The high commission fees charged by centralized sports books is not conducive to long term player satisfaction and retention.
2. Lack of liquidity for individual betting markets in decentralized models leads to lower limits and fewer betting options.
3. Especially in the centralized and physical sports betting models, individual player tracking, limitation, and restriction based on large or frequent winnings is available and somewhat unavoidable with large sums of money.
4. Both centralized and decentralized online sports books currently have interfaces designed for a narrow user base which creates artificial barriers to entry for new players and those unfamiliar with each vendor’s idiosyncrasies.

These issues are all addressable, and at OpenBook we intend to solve all of them with our unique and elegant hybrid model.
