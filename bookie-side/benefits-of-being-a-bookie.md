# Benefits of Being a Bookie

The most vital benefit for most Bookies will be the APR % that is awarded as profit for staking DAI in our liquidity pool. This profit APR % will fluctuate as time progresses based on protocol performance. In addition, the 2% vig taken on every bet is used to fill the liquidity pool, of which Bookies have a percentage stake and thus will gain incremental benefits from its growth.\

In the future, our hope is to further incentivize the connection between Bettor and Bookie. Our plan for this includes a tiered bonus system based on either amount staked, time staked, or other metrics. The bonus is an increasing discount on the vig when placing bets, all the way down to near 0% at the highest tier. We may also include additional benefit programs to promote Bookie retention and acquisition as we grow the protocol.
