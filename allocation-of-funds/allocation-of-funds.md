# Allocation of funds

We already touched upon a bit of the fund allocation sporadically throughout this whitepaper, but as we are currently finishing up with Phase 1 of the roadmap, our allocation of investment funds will be quite simple. On the agenda are several pressing matters to be addressed in Phase 2 of developing the full protocol to be deployed on the Polygon mainnet. Given that we are not in any way soliciting investment or fundraising in this whitepaper, we will not be putting forth any numerical cost projections. Instead, here is a list in the general priority order of areas that will need funding (subject to change at any time as development progresses):

* Once all contracts are finalized and tested thoroughly internally, we will need to do a trusted third party security audit of the entire OpenBook protocol suite of contracts, ensuring no misuse or mishandling of user’s money. These audits vary widely in price depending on the complexity of the code base and number of contracts.
* The legal environment around sports betting as previously discussed is complicated, to make a massive understatement. Hiring competent attorneys to help us navigate the legal sea is integral to our further development.
* Obtaining odds from external providers in our new model will cost us on the operational side. This will be shouldered by the founders in the beginning, but as OpenBook scales the odds acquisition will need to be funded by the protocol itself.
* The update odds gas fees are separate, however, and will be mitigated on the transaction side by Bettors that happen to send transactions upon the infrequent occurrence of a necessary update. These costs are inconsequential and won’t be noticeable in relation to regular daily gas fee fluctuations.
* To remain focused on completing this project, competent software developers will need to be financially capable of continued work on the project or acquired from outside sources.

These are the first of a line of issues that will require funding during the process of developing and deploying OpenBook.
