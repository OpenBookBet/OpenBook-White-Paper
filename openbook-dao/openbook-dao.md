# OpenBook DAO

A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is designed to divide the ownership and management of the happenings within said organization between all members involved instead of centralizing that control. They also serve the purpose of automating these operations. Forbes author Cathy Hackl sums them up perfectly in this excerpt:

Wikipedia defines DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles. (Hackl 2021)

In the Web3 space, a DAO is typically associated with a token known as a governance token. This token represents proportional ownership stake of the protocol to which it belongs. Most key decisions regarding the protocol will be made by voters using the token instead of by a board of directors or CEO. These decisions can include everything from commission percentage to selection of odds providers and more.

OpenBook hopes to move in the direction of a DAO in the future. Web3 is built on and run by its communities and should stay that way. In the case of OpenBook, the centralized components only serve to nurture and grow the fledgling project until it gains enough traction to transition into the hands of the community it fosters.
