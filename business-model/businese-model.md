# Businese Model

In the beginning, we had no idea we would need to create a business model for this project. This necessity quickly became apparent after our decision to build a decentralized sports book; after all, to effectively operate a service that handles the transfer of other people’s money, that service will need to sustain its own endeavors as well. By coincidence, as our operational designs evolved, a simple and clear business approach emerged. The diagram below pictures the fundamental connections OpenBook maintains with its different users and the primary value transfers that occur between each:

Our choice to fuse the current centralized and decentralized sports book standards left us with a litany of directions to choose in service of sustaining OpenBook’s activities. All the same, we felt the best option was a simple one that removed the predatory quality of centralized profit patterns.
